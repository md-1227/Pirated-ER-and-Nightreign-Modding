Steps-
#What everyone (even paid owners) must do
1. Installing Vins:
	Extract the .zip anywhere and follow the readme.txt that is provided with Vins.
2. Adding Seamless:
	- Take the SeamlessCoop folder and move it into the "ELDEN VINS" folder.
	- Right click on config_eldenring.toml and select "Edit with Notepad".
	- You should edit the external_dlls section to match this:
# external_dlls = [ "coolmod.dll", "D:\\nicemods\\nicemod.dll", "sosofolder\sosomod.dll" ]
external_dlls = [
	"SeamlessCoop//ersc.dll",
	"mod//dll//Scripts-Data-Exposer-FS.dll",
	"mod//dll//eldenring_covenant_slot.dll",
	"mod//dll//ErdTools.dll",
	"mod//dll//ERSkeletonMan_Agheel.dll",
	"mod//dll//ERSkeletonMan_Alecto.dll",
	"mod//dll//ERSkeletonMan_Faurtis.dll"
]
	- Save the changes
#Paid owners can just use "Launch ELDEN VINS.bat" to play
#Now for the pirated owners
3. Making it look like you have ELDEN RING on steam
	i. Moving files:
		- Go to Steam\steamapps\common
		- Create a new folder and name it "ELDEN RING"
		- Move the "Game" folder from the pirated installation into this new folder.
	ii. Creating fake manifest:
		- Go back to Steam\steamapps
		Note: hopefully you have installed even one steam game before, you need to make a copy of any one of the files that are named "appmanifest_" and then some random numbers.
		- Make a copy of a manifest and rename it to "appmanifest_1245620"
		- Right click on it and select edit in Notepad
		- Change these specifically
	"appid"		"1245620"
	"name"		"ELDEN RING"
	"installdir"		"ELDEN RING"
		- Save the changes

You SHOULD be done by now. Launch using "Launch ELDEN VINS.bat" and have some patience; It may take a bit to launch, but that might depend on the pc.
NOTE: If the game doesn't run after all this, try moving all the contents of "ELDEN VINS" folder into the "Game" folder aswell.
NOTE: If an error pops up and the window name is of the FOV mod, it's fine. The game will run afterward.
